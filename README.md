# Synthetic-Gene-Circuit

## Overview
This project involves simulating a synthetic gene circuit, specifically recreating the mathematical model from the research paper _"Modeling a synthetic multicellular clock: Repressilators coupled by quorum sensing."_ The goal of the project was to simulate the behavior of interconnected biological circuits and analyze how communication between cells can synchronize their activity using Python. The project applies differential equation modeling to simulate the system and visualizes the results using Matplotlib.

## Features
- **Mathematical Modeling**: Implemented the mathematical model described in the paper using Python to simulate the dynamics of a synthetic multicellular clock.
- **Differential Equations**: Modeled the system using ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to represent the interactions within and between cells.
- **Simulation**: Applied SciPy's ODE solvers to simulate the system's behavior over time, analyzing the impact of key parameters on cell synchronization.
- **Visualization**: Plotted the simulation results using Matplotlib, visualizing the time evolution of the system and how cells achieve synchronization through quorum sensing.
